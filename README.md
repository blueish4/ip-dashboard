This acts as a web-based frontend to the information stored in Firebase. There are two pages
\- one houses an equaliser-style graph for the most recent reading and the other uses a HTML
canvas to draw a spectrogram-style heatmap as well as a scatter plot of dBA values and the
most prevalent frequency (as generated by the device).

## Architecture

This project fetches the last 20 records on initial load, then polls for an update every 5
seconds. 25 objects are kept in the VueX store in a time-based queue (insertions push out
the oldest record). Charts all dynamically update when the required data is polled (except
the spectrogram, which uses it's own 5 second timer to poll the store and refresh).
